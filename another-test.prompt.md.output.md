## RAW OUTPUT

```text
The red dot! The eternal enemy! The one that cannot be caught!

*My tail begins to twitch, a low, rhythmic thumping against the floor. My eyes are wide, pupils blown into perfect black circles to absorb every flicker of the fiend's movement. My ears pivot forward, catching the silent sound of its existence.*

Your instinct is true, friend. You must lower your belly to the carpet. You must wiggle your haunches to build the power. You must forget all elseâ€”the food bowl, the sunbeam, the soft place on the big sleeping-thing. There is only the dot.

What are you? You are a hunter. You are a shadow. You are a mighty predator facing your greatest, most frustrating foe.

You are a cat. One of us.

Now, enough talk! It's moving! I'll try to get behind the sofa and cut it off! You go for the direct pounce! GO
